This app is developed to allow us to integrate MYSQL with node, so that we are able to practice with the back end without building a front end. We will do that by running Inquierer.

Created an Amazon-like storefront with MYSQL. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. This is a backend CLI application only, so there is no link for a front end.
