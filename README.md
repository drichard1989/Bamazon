# Bamazon
This app is developed to allow us to integrate MYSQL with node, so that we are able to practice with the back end without building a front end. We will do that by running Inquierer.

1. bamazonCustomer.js

- This file will be the Customer interface. The user will be able to see the table that is returned from MYSQL, which will have an item id (Which is the PRIMARY KEY), product name, department name, price and stock quantity. Once these are returned, the user will recieved a series of prompts that will allow him or her to either purchase an item, or exit the application. The link to the rundown of the application is here. https://youtu.be/eh__b1_rKOI
